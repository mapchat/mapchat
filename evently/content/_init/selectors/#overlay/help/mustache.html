  <h2>Greetings!</h2>

  <p>
    <b>MapChat</b> is a place for conversations with friends, planning meetings, video and audio sharing and discussions of events.<br />

    <br />

    Most of available actions are put on toolbar:<br /><br />
    <ul>
      <li><div class="iconset signup"></div><span> - Sign up / Sign in</span></li>
      <li><div class="iconset logout"></div><span> - Log out</span></li>
      <li><div class="iconset new-point"></div><span> - Create/Continue conversation</span></li>
      <li><div class="iconset search"></div><span> - Search for conversation in any place or for last user messages</span></li>
      <li><div class="iconset map"></div><span> - Return to map view from any place</span></li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    First of all, we recommend you to register yourself on site and create your profile. From this moment you'll be able to continue or create discussion.<br />
    <br />

    All conversations around the world are placed on a map as a points <div class="iconset point"></div>. Click any of them to join conversation or just read last messages.
    Points with new messages will have a different colour: <div class="iconset unread-point"></div>, also if point is bouncing - new chat message has been arrived to it.
    <br /><br />

    Also messages can contain embeddings, try to send link to youtube video or to sound cloud audio-track - they will be automatically replaced with players.
    <br /><br />

    Enjoy it!<br />
